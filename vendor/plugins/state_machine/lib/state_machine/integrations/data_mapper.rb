module StateMachine
  module Integrations #:nodoc:
    # Adds support for integrating state machines with DataMapper resources.
    # 
    # == Examples
    # 
    # Below is an example of a simple state machine defined within a
    # DataMapper resource:
    # 
    #   class Vehicle
    #     include DataMapper::Resource
    #     
    #     property :id, Serial
    #     property :name, String
    #     property :state, String
    #     
    #     state_machine :initial => :parked do
    #       event :ignite do
    #         transition :parked => :idling
    #       end
    #     end
    #   end
    # 
    # The examples in the sections below will use the above class as a
    # reference.
    # 
    # == Actions
    # 
    # By default, the action that will be invoked when a state is transitioned
    # is the +save+ action.  This will cause the resource to save the changes
    # made to the state machine's attribute.  *Note* that if any other changes
    # were made to the resource prior to transition, then those changes will
    # be saved as well.
    # 
    # For example,
    # 
    #   vehicle = Vehicle.create          # => #<Vehicle id=1 name=nil state="parked">
    #   vehicle.name = 'Ford Explorer'
    #   vehicle.ignite                    # => true
    #   vehicle.reload                    # => #<Vehicle id=1 name="Ford Explorer" state="idling">
    # 
    # == Transactions
    # 
    # In order to ensure that any changes made during transition callbacks
    # are rolled back during a failed attempt, every transition is wrapped
    # within a transaction.
    # 
    # For example,
    # 
    #   class Message
    #     include DataMapper::Resource
    #     
    #     property :id, Serial
    #     property :content, String
    #   end
    #   
    #   Vehicle.state_machine do
    #     before_transition do |transition|
    #       Message.create(:content => transition.inspect)
    #       throw :halt
    #     end
    #   end
    #   
    #   vehicle = Vehicle.create      # => #<Vehicle id=1 name=nil state="parked">
    #   vehicle.ignite                # => false
    #   Message.all.count             # => 0
    # 
    # *Note* that only before callbacks that halt the callback chain and
    # failed attempts to save the record will result in the transaction being
    # rolled back.  If an after callback halts the chain, the previous result
    # still applies and the transaction is *not* rolled back.
    # 
    # == Validation errors
    # 
    # If an event fails to successfully fire because there are no matching
    # transitions for the current record, a validation error is added to the
    # record's state attribute to help in determining why it failed and for
    # reporting via the UI.
    # 
    # For example,
    # 
    #   vehicle = Vehicle.create(:state => 'idling')  # => #<Vehicle id=1 name=nil state="idling">
    #   vehicle.ignite                                # => false
    #   vehicle.errors.full_messages                  # => ["cannot be transitioned via :ignite from :idling"]
    # 
    # If an event fails to fire because of a validation error on the record and
    # *not* because a matching transition was not available, no error messages
    # will be added to the state attribute.
    # 
    # == Scopes
    # 
    # To assist in filtering models with specific states, a series of class
    # methods are defined on the model for finding records with or without a
    # particular set of states.
    # 
    # These named scopes are the functional equivalent of the following
    # definitions:
    # 
    #   class Vehicle
    #     include DataMapper::Resource
    #     
    #     property :id, Serial
    #     property :state, String
    #     
    #     class << self
    #       def with_states(*states)
    #         all(:state => states.flatten)
    #       end
    #       alias_method :with_state, :with_states
    #       
    #       def without_states(*states)
    #         all(:state.not => states.flatten)
    #       end
    #       alias_method :without_state, :without_states
    #     end
    #   end
    # 
    # *Note*, however, that the states are converted to their stored values
    # before being passed into the query.
    # 
    # Because of the way scopes work in DataMapper, they can be chained like
    # so:
    # 
    #   Vehicle.with_state(:parked).all(:order => [:id.desc])
    # 
    # == Callbacks / Observers
    # 
    # All before/after transition callbacks defined for DataMapper resources
    # behave in the same way that other DataMapper hooks behave.  Rather than
    # passing in the record as an argument to the callback, the callback is
    # instead bound to the object and evaluated within its context.
    # 
    # For example,
    # 
    #   class Vehicle
    #     include DataMapper::Resource
    #     
    #     property :id, Serial
    #     property :state, String
    #     
    #     state_machine :initial => :parked do
    #       before_transition any => :idling do
    #         put_on_seatbelt
    #       end
    #       
    #       before_transition do |transition|
    #         # log message
    #       end
    #       
    #       event :ignite do
    #         transition :parked => :idling
    #       end
    #     end
    #     
    #     def put_on_seatbelt
    #       ...
    #     end
    #   end
    # 
    # Note, also, that the transition can be accessed by simply defining
    # additional arguments in the callback block.
    # 
    # In addition to support for DataMapper-like hooks, there is additional
    # support for DataMapper observers.  See StateMachine::Integrations::DataMapper::Observer
    # for more information.
