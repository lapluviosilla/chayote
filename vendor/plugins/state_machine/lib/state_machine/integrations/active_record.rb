module StateMachine
  module Integrations #:nodoc:
    # Adds support for integrating state machines with ActiveRecord models.
    # 
    # == Examples
    # 
    # Below is an example of a simple state machine defined within an
    # ActiveRecord model:
    # 
    #   class Vehicle < ActiveRecord::Base
    #     state_machine :initial => :parked do
    #       event :ignite do
    #         transition :parked => :idling
    #       end
    #     end
    #   end
    # 
    # The examples in the sections below will use the above class as a
    # reference.
    # 
    # == Actions
    # 
    # By default, the action that will be invoked when a state is transitioned
    # is the +save+ action.  This will cause the record to save the changes
    # made to the state machine's attribute.  *Note* that if any other changes
    # were made to the record prior to transition, then those changes will
    # be saved as well.
    # 
    # For example,
    # 
    #   vehicle = Vehicle.create          # => #<Vehicle id: 1, name: nil, state: "parked">
    #   vehicle.name = 'Ford Explorer'
    #   vehicle.ignite                    # => true
    #   vehicle.reload                    # => #<Vehicle id: 1, name: "Ford Explorer", state: "idling">
    # 
    # == Transactions
    # 
    # In order to ensure that any changes made during transition callbacks
    # are rolled back during a failed attempt, every transition is wrapped
    # within a transaction.
    # 
    # For example,
    # 
    #   class Message < ActiveRecord::Base
    #   end
    #   
    #   Vehicle.state_machine do
    #     before_transition do |vehicle, transition|
    #       Message.create(:content => transition.inspect)
    #       false
    #     end
    #   end
    #   
    #   vehicle = Vehicle.create      # => #<Vehicle id: 1, name: nil, state: "parked">
    #   vehicle.ignite                # => false
    #   Message.count                 # => 0
    # 
    # *Note* that only before callbacks that halt the callback chain and
    # failed attempts to save the record will result in the transaction being
    # rolled back.  If an after callback halts the chain, the previous result
    # still applies and the transaction is *not* rolled back.
    # 
    # == Validation errors
    # 
    # If an event fails to successfully fire because there are no matching
    # transitions for the current record, a validation error is added to the
    # record's state attribute to help in determining why it failed and for
    # reporting via the UI.
    # 
    # For example,
    # 
    #   vehicle = Vehicle.create(:state => 'idling')  # => #<Vehicle id: 1, name: nil, state: "idling">
    #   vehicle.ignite                                # => false
    #   vehicle.errors.full_messages                  # => ["State cannot be transitioned via :ignite from :idling"]
    # 
    # If an event fails to fire because of a validation error on the record and
    # *not* because a matching transition was not available, no error messages
    # will be added to the state attribute.
    # 
    # == Scopes
    # 
    # To assist in filtering models with specific states, a series of named
    # scopes are defined on the model for finding records with or without a
    # particular set of states.
    # 
    # These named scopes are essentially the functional equivalent of the
    # following definitions:
    # 
    #   class Vehicle < ActiveRecord::Base
    #     named_scope :with_states, lambda {|*states| {:conditions => {:state => states}}}
    #     # with_states also aliased to with_state
    #     
    #     named_scope :without_states, lambda {|*states| {:conditions => ['state NOT IN (?)', states]}}
    #     # without_states also aliased to without_state
    #   end
    # 
    # *Note*, however, that the states are converted to their stored values
    # before being passed into the query.
    # 
    # Because of the way named scopes work in ActiveRecord, they can be
    # chained like so:
    # 
    #   Vehicle.with_state(:parked).all(:order => 'id DESC')
    # 
    # == Callbacks
    # 
    # All before/after transition callbacks defined for ActiveRecord models
    # behave in the same way that other ActiveRecord callbacks behave.  The
    # object involved in the transition is passed in as an argument.
    # 
    # For example,
    # 
    #   class Vehicle < ActiveRecord::Base
    #     state_machine :initial => :parked do
    #       before_transition any => :idling do |vehicle|
    #         vehicle.put_on_seatbelt
    #       end
    #       
    #       before_transition do |vehicle, transition|
    #         # log message
    #       end
    #       
    #       event :ignite do
    #         transition :parked => :idling
    #       end
    #     end
    #     
    #     def put_on_seatbelt
    #       ...
    #     end
    #   end
    # 
    # Note, also, that the transition can be accessed by simply defining
    # additional arguments in the callback block.
    # 
    # == Observers
    # 
    # In addition to support for ActiveRecord-like hooks, there is additional
    # support for ActiveRecord observers.  Because of the way ActiveRecord
    # observers are designed, there is less flexibility around the specific
    # transitions that can be hooked in.  As a result, observers can only
    # hook into before/after callbacks for events and generic transitions
    # like so:
    # 
    #   class VehicleObserver < ActiveRecord::Observer
    #     def before_save(vehicle)
    #       # log message
    #     end
    #     
    #     # Callback for :ignite event *before* the transition is performed
    #     def before_ignite(vehicle, transition)
    #       # log message
    #     end
    #     
    #     # Callback for :ignite event *after* the transition has been performed
    #     def after_ignite(vehicle, transition)
    #       # put on seatbelt
    #     end
    #     
    #     # Generic transition callback *before* the transition is performed
    #     def after_transition(vehicle, transition)
    #       Audit.log(vehicle, transition)
    #     end
    #   end
    # 
    # More flexible transition callbacks can be defined directly within the
    # model as described in StateMachine::Machine#before_transition
    # and StateMachine::Machine#after_transition.
    # 
    # To define a single observer for multiple state machines:
    # 
    #   class StateMachineObserver < ActiveRecord::Observer
    #     observe Vehicle, Switch, Project
    #     
    #     def after_transition(record, transition)
    #       Audit.log(record, transition)
    #     end
    #   end

      # Classes that inherit from ActiveRecord::Base will automatically use
