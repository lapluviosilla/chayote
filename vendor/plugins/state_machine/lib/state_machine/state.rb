  # A state defines a value that an attribute can be in after being transitioned
  # 0 or more times.  States can represent a value of any type in Ruby, though
  # the most common (and default) type is String.
  # 
  # In addition to defining the machine's value, a state can also define a
  # behavioral context for an object when that object is in the state.  See
  # StateMachine::Machine#state for more information about how state-driven
  # behavior can be utilized.
